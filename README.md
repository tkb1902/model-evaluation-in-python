Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for evaluating NLP and other machine learning models on various datasets. Model evaluation is a crucial step in the development of machine learning applications, ensuring that models perform well and meet the required standards. This project leverages different evaluation techniques and libraries in Python.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare data for model evaluation.
Text Vectorization: Methods to convert text data into numerical format suitable for model input.
Model Evaluation: Implementation of various metrics and techniques to assess the performance of machine learning models, including:
Cross Validation
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
R-Squared
Silhouette Score for clustering models
Churn Modeling for customer retention analysis
ROC Curve & AUC
Grid Search and Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning
Visualization: Plotting results to gain insights from the evaluation process.
Structure
The repository contains the following files:

1. Cross Validation and its types.ipynb: Notebook explaining cross-validation techniques.
3. XGBoost.ipynb: Notebook for training and evaluating XGBoost models.
Churn_Modelling.csv: Dataset for churn modeling.
Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.ipynb: Notebook for evaluating models using confusion matrix and related metrics.
Grid Search and Randomized Search.ipynb: Notebook for hyperparameter tuning.

Data
The data directory contains sample datasets used for model evaluation. You can replace these with your own datasets if needed. The notebooks include code to load and preprocess this data.

Usage
Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebooks to:

Load and preprocess the data.
Vectorize the text using techniques like TF-IDF.
Train machine learning models using various algorithms.
Evaluate the performance of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R-squared, silhouette score, and others.
Visualize the evaluation results using plots.
